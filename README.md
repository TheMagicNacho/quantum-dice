<h1>The Quantum Dice</h1>
The Quantum Dice leverages the IBM Q quantum computer 
to generate a truly random set of numbers.

<h3>Background</h3>
My brother taught me how to play D&D over Christmas,
but I noticed that all the dice apps really sucked. <br>
The apps I found were clunky and slow. So I tried to develop my own app.<br>
While creating the original dice app I learned about how pseudo random numbers were generated.
So I decided to improve upon the application by leveraging quantum computers.
<br><br>
NOW YOU CAN PLAY WITH A QUANTUM DEVICE!<br>
With this app, literally all possibilities exist and a single measurable outcome is provided to you.
